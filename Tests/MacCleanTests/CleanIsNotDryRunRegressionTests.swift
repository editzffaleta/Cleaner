/// Regression test for the "clean reports success but doesn't actually

///
/// Cause: every view's `clean()` method was calling
/// `appState.cleaningEngine.clean(items: items, mode: .dryRun)` — leftover
/// development scaffolding that returned counts as if files were deleted
/// but never touched the filesystem.
///
/// This test scans every view file in the MacClean target and fails the
/// build if any of them passes `mode: .dryRun` to `cleaningEngine.clean()`.
/// `.dryRun` is fine for tests and previews — never for production view
/// actions that the user expects to actually clean their disk.
